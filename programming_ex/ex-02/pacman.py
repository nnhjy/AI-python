# Creating a grid for the Pac-Man to wander around.
# The grid is given as a list of string, e.g.
# [".......",
#  ".XXX.X.",
#  ".XXX...",
#  ".XXX.X.",
#  ".....X.",
#  ".XXXXX.",
#  "......."]
# Here the important information is the size of the grid,
# in Y direction the number of string, and in the X direction
# the length of the strings, and whether there is X in
# a grid cell. Pac-Man can enter any cell that is not a wall
# cell marked with X.
# The bottom left cell is (0,0). Cells outside the explicitly
# stated grid are all wall cells.

class PacManGrid:
    def __init__(self,grid):
        self.grid = grid
        self.xmax = len(grid[0]) - 1
        self.ymax = len(grid) - 1

    # Test whether the cell (x,y) is wall.

        if x < 0 or y < 0 or x > self.xmax or y > self.ymax:

# State space search problems are represented in terms of states.
# For each state there are a number of actions that are applicable in
# that state. Any of the applicable actions will produce a successor
# state for the state. To use a state space in search algorithms, we
# also need functions for producing a hash value for a state
# (the function hash) and for testing equality of two states.
#
# In this exercise we represent states as Python classes with the
# following components.
#
#   __init__    To create a state (a starting state for search)
#   __repr__    To construct a string that represents the state
#   __hash__    Hash function for states
#   __eq__      Equality for states
#   successors  Returns a list [(a1,s1),...,(aN,sN)] where each si
#               is the successor state when action ai is taken.
#               Here the name ai of an action is a string.

# The state of the Pac-Man (given a grid) consists of
# three components:
# x: the X coordinate 0..self.grid.xmax
# y: the Y coordinate 0..self.grid.ymax
# d: the direction "N", "S", "E", "W" Pac-Man is going
# Based on this information, the possible successor states
# of (x,y,d) are computed by 'successors'.
