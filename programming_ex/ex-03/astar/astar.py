def astar(start_state, goaltest, h):
    """
    Perform A-star search.

    Finds a sequence of actions from `start_state` to some end state satisfying 
    the `goaltest` function by performing A-star search.

    This function returns a policy, i.e. a sequence of actions which, if
    successively applied to `start_state` will transform it into a state which
    satisfies `goaltest`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start_state : State
       State object with `successors` function.
    goaltest : Function (State -> bool)
       A function which takes a State object as parameter and returns True if 
       the state is an acceptable goal state.
    h : Function (State -> float)
       Heuristic function estimating the distance from a state to the goal.
       This is the h(s) in f(s) = h(s) + g(s).
    
    Returns
    -------
    list of actions
       The policy for transforming start_state into one which is accepted by
       `goaltest`.

    # The gotten pair is removed from Q
    Q = PriorityQueue()
    # Elements are listed in the order of increasing 'prio', 
    # Q.get() fetches the 1st pair as having the smallest 'prio' value

    # TASK
    # ---------------------------------
    # Complete the A* star implementation.

    # depending on your implementation).
    # Remember to return the plan (list of Actions).
    #
    # You can look at bfs.py to see how a compatible BFS algorithm can be
    # implemented.
    #
    # The A* algorithm can be found in the MyCourses material.
    #
    # Take care that you don't implement the GBFS algorithm by mistake:
    #  note that you should return a solution only when you *know* it is
    #  optimal (how?)
    #
    # Good luck!
